# Overview

Examine the relationships presented in today's presentation, and implement an association, aggregation, and composition relationship that closely mirrors those models.

- Use PEP8 regardless of the naming conventions in the UML diagrams
- Place each class in its own file and use imports as appropriate
- Use a main.py file to instantiate your objects and test your code
- You may also want to practice the example generalization and realization relationships

## Your notes
Before you begin write down what each of the relationships mean and try and recall how they are represented in UML:

- Association: ...
- Generalization: ...
- Realization: ...
- Aggregation: ...
- Composition: ...

What is cardinality and how is it represented in UML? Try and think of a few examples.

## Tips

- Some of the diagrams have been reproduced in mermaid syntax, see:
  - [Association](./association.md)
  - [Aggregation](./aggregation.md)
  - [Composition](./composition.md)

- There are solutions to the examples in a separate branch: `2024/s2/raf-solutions` but try not to rely on those!
