# Overview

In this lesson, we will apply what we've learned about the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) to simple examples in Python. We will create classes and objects, and use inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to model simple problems.

This lesson is designed to support the slide material presented on Blackboard.

## Revision

To help you with KBA part 2, here is some quick revision from last term:

- **Sequence**: In our context, refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. A sequence usually means statements are executed one after the other. Do not confuse this with the `list` data type in Python.

- **Selection**: Refers to the ability to choose between two or more paths in a program. This is usually done using an `if` statement.

- **Iteration**: Refers to the ability to repeat a block of code multiple times. This is usually done using a `for` or `while` loop.

## Reflect

Before we begin, write down a simple single-sentence definition of each of the four pillars:

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. The purported benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).

```python

class Animal:
    pass

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

```

In this example, `Cat` is a derived class inherited from the base class `Animal`. The `Cat` class will inherit all the attributes and methods of the `Animal` class (currently, there aren't any).

Before we go into the mechanics of subclassing and overriding, we must understand what we have said. By saying that `Cat` inherits from `Animal`, we are saying that `Cat` **is a** `Animal`. Specifically, any cat we instantiate is **both** a `Cat` and an `Animal`. All cats are animals, but not all animals are cats. This is the essence of inheritance.

### Inheriting methods and attributes

Whatever methods are defined in the base class will be available to the derived class.

For example:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} speaks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def purr(self):
        print(f"{self.name} purrs")

# Any cat must have a name and can speak and purr!

cat = Cat('Whiskers')
cat.speak() # speaks
cat.purr() # purrs
```

Semantically, we are saying, "all animals must have a name and can speak. Only cats can purr."

### Overriding methods

Methods or attributes are overridden whenever we define an attribute or method in a derived class, which is already defined in the base class. The derived class will use its own implementation of the method or attribute and no longer inherit the base class's implementation. In Python, this is all or nothing.

For example:

```python
class Dog(Animal):
   pass


class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} meows")

cat = Cat('Whiskers')
dog = Dog('Rover')

cat.speak() # meows
dog.speak() # speaks
```

Sometimes we want to combine the functionality of the base class with the derived class. We can do this by calling the base class's method from the derived class's method. This is done using the `super()` function.

The most common use of `super()` is in the `__init__` method of a derived class. This is because we often want to initialize the base class's attributes before initializing the derived class's attributes.

For example:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.color = color

cat = Cat('Whiskers', 'black')
cat.speak() # speaks

```

Notice that all animals must have a name, but only cats have a color. Try the above without calling `super`, and note any differences!

### Intermediate topics

The following section is **optional** and not required for completion of the course.

#### Inheritance from `object`

In Python, classes that don't inherit from any other class are implicitly derived from the `object` **class**. This is because all classes in Python are objects (more precisely all objects in Python are of type object). The `object` class is the base class for all classes in Python. And it is the reason why even an empty class has 'stuff' - attributes and methods.

In older versions of Python, we had to explicitly inherit from `object`:

```python
# Don't do this:

class Animal(object):
    pass

# Since it is **exactly** equivalent to the more succint:

class Animal:
    pass
```

It is no longer necessary, and indeed undesirable, to write classes that explicitly inherit from `object` (though it is still _possible_).

#### Using `insinstance` instead of `type`

You are finally ready to understand why, in Python, we typically **don't** use the built-in `type` _class_ to check the type of an object. Instead, we use the `isinstance` _function_. This is because `isinstance` is aware of inheritance and returns a `bool`, while `type` returns the class of an object (aka the 'type') or creates new classes ('types').

For example:

```python

cat = Cat('Whiskers', 'black')

print(type(cat) is Cat) # True
print(type(cat) is Animal) # False!
print(isinstance(cat, Cat)) # True
print(isinstance(cat, Animal)) # True - much better.

```

The `cat` instance **is** an `Animal`, but only `isinstance` reveals this. The `type` function does not. It is almost always more correct to use `isinstance` than `type`.

#### `is-a` vs `has-a`

Inheritance used to be synonymous with OOP. However, in modern software development practices, it is now considered a last resort. This is because inheritance is a very strong relationship. Another term for it is 'coupling' - anything we do to the base class will affect every derived class and every class that derives from those classes, and so on. This can lead to a lot of unintended consequences.

In modern software development, we prefer composition over inheritance. Composition is a `has-a` relationship. Instead of saying a class 'is-a' another type, we try to form relationships that a class 'has-a' another type. This is a much looser relationship and is more flexible but still allows for reuse and code organization.

Composition involves passing (or instantiating) an instance of one class to/in another class.

Raf's golden rule: "if a relationship can be described as `has-a` use composition." Raf's corollary: "almost all relationships _can_ be described as `has-a`.". Finally, if you are sure that inheritance can actually help organize your solution, inherit from an abstract class or interface (that's coming up).

**Consider**: suppose all animals have a tail and can speak. We want to ensure cats receive these properties, but we don't want to inherit from the `Animal` class. How could we do it using composition?

### Terminology note

In OOP, many terms refer to the action of inheriting from a class.

A class that inherits another class, will variously be referred to as any of the following:

- Derived class
- Subclass
- Child/descendent class
- Extended class
- Specialized class

The class that is inherited from will variously be referred to as any of the following:

- Base class
- Superclass
- Parent/ancestor class
- Generalized class

For our purposes, we can think of these terms as being interchangeable. Though, in some contexts, one term may be more appropriate than another.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about setting some boundaries. It is the practice of keeping the internal state of an object private and only exposing a public interface. This is done by using access modifiers (private vs. public).

In Python, there is no strict _privacy_ as there are in some other languages.

Instead, we indicate the **intended** privacy of an attribute or method by using a single underscore `_` or double underscore `__` prefix. While this is largely a convention, it does have some practical implications (discussed in the advanced section).

Lots of texts will give various explanations for `_` versus `__`, but we will always use a `_` underscore, and "just because" is a good enough reason.

### Private methods/attributes

When a method or attribute starts with an underscore (`_`) it should only be accessed within the class. It should never be accessed from outside the class. Notice _should_ â€“ there is no enforcement in Python, but you should adhere to this closely, particularly this semester.
For example:

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name # indicates no one should rename a cat after instantiation

    def meow(self):
        print(f"{self._name} meows") # this is fine.


cat = Cat('Whiskers')

cat._name = 'Rover' # this can be done but shouldn't be done.
```

### Optional topics: encapsulation

While not essential for the course, the following sections provide a deeper understanding of encapsulation.

#### Intermediate: Why encapsulate?

When you hear "protecting" or "hiding" data, you might think of security. But encapsulation is not about security. It is about managing complexity. By encapsulating data, we can ensure that the internal state of an object is consistent and valid. This makes it easier to reason about the object and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

Suppose we start in a world where any attribute can be accessed or modified by any part of the program. We might find that an object will end up in a state that is inconsistent and invalid and then we have to try and track down "who done it?". As programs grow, this 'who done it' can be a proper detective novel.

**Examples:**

- Our cat suddenly has a negative age. That can't be right! But who did it? Without encapsulation, it could be anyone.
- Our cat's name is 42. Well, actually that is an awesome name... but anyway, that is not a real name. Who did it? Why did we let this happen?

Encapsulation lets us say:

> "look, if you want to change some aspect of the state of the object, you have to go through a gatekeeper - a method that will ensure that the state is consistent and valid."

Encapsulation doesn't just apply to attributes. It also applies to methods.

We can have private methods that are only used within the class. This can help to break up the logic of a class into smaller, more manageable pieces while not exposing things that don't make sense to expose, or more importantly, that could be dangerous to expose (e.g. lead to an inconsistent state).

For example, we might have a `Cat` class with a `meow` method that is public, but a `_sit_on_the_keyboard` method that is private. This method is only used when the `meow` method doesn't get the attention it deserves. It really doesn't make sense to call `_sit_on_the_keyboard` from outside the class. It should only be called by the cat itself when `meow` doesn't work.

If you didn't understand the last example, don't worry: it just means you don't have a cat, you might still understand OOP. Maybe.

But the point is: you don't **need** to ever make a cat sit on a keyboard, no one ever said "I want to make a cat sit on a keyboard' it is just something the cat does.

##### Getters and setters

Soon, we will look at `properties`, which are a more Pythonic way of handling getters and setters. But for now, we will use the more traditional approach.

A getter is a method that gets the value of an attribute. A setter is a method that sets the value of an attribute. By using getters and setters, we can control how attributes are accessed and modified.

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self._name

    def set_name(self, name):
        self._name = name
```

#### An even more advanced note

In Python texts, the single versus double underscore is often explained as (a) a convention and (b) implies that the difference between the two is that a single underscore is somehow less private than a double underscore. This explanation can be misleading.

##### Myth 1: Underscores are just a convention

In Python, attributes and methods with a single underscore are by default not imported when using `from module import *`. A double underscore is a "name mangling" feature. This means that the attribute is renamed to `_classname__attribute` to avoid name clashes.

The reason it is sometimes called a 'convention' is that Python doesn't **enforce** privacy. It is up to the programmer to respect the underscore(s). However, the leading underscores **do** have a concrete affect, unlike, say, `snake_case` or `camelCase`.

##### Myth 2: Use a double underscore when you really want to make something private

Because of name mangling, a double underscore will make inadvertent (or advertent) access to a method or attribute more difficult from outside the class and particularly from subclasses. However, this feature can make debugging more difficult (what you see, is not what you get).

In a technical sense, a single underscore is 'protected', and a double underscore is 'private'. But in a practical sense, it is not a distinction you need to worry about. Generally, issues around name mangling tend to come up in framework development and are seldom encountered in day-to-day Python programming. Rather, Pythonistas tend to default to a single underscore because it looks better and is less likely to cause confusion. Many Python texts don't even make a distinction between private/protected; so, for our purposes, we will usually infer that a single underscore is intended to be private.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of identifying and exposing the essential characteristics of an object while ignoring the irrelevant details, thus making it easier to use and allowing generalization of the kind of objects that can be handled in the same way (see, Polymorphism).

Using a car analogy, think about the vehicle **Start** button: the `start` action is an abstraction that represents what we want to do with the car, but has little relationship to how the car implements this behavior (or even the fact that it is composed of multiple discrete actions). In addition to making it easier to map intention to action, i.e. making it easier to use the object, it also opens the road to providing common *interfaces* to fundamentally different behaviors: think **Start** on a combustion car versus an electric car.

Since abstraction opens the door to generalization, we may as well talk about `abstract` classes and `interfaces` here. 

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used **only** to define a blueprint for other classes. An interface is a class that contains abstract methods (methods without a concrete implementation) and is used to define a contract for other classes.

In Python, we can use the `abc` module to create abstract classes and interfaces. An ABC (Abstract Base Class) is a mixin - it can be used to define both abstract methods and concrete methods, but regardless an ABC cannot itself be instantiated.

### Creating an ABC

To create an ABC, we need to import the `ABC` class from the `abc` module and use it as a base class for our abstract class.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self): ...

```

Try and create an instance of the `Animal` class:

```python
animal = Animal('Rover')
```

What happens?

In the above example, the `Animal` class is an abstract class. It cannot be instantiated, but it can be used as a base class for other classes. The `speak` method is an abstract method, which means that any class that inherits from the `Animal` class must implement the `speak` method.

The `@` symbol is a decorator. Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of functions or methods. In this case, the `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to indicate that the `speak` method is an abstract method.

Try the following and see what happens:

```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

dog = Dog('Rover')
dog.speak()
cat = Cat('Whiskers')
cat.speak()
```

Make sure you know **when** the code above fails.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the biggest word, but it is not that hard a concept. Particularly if you understand inheritance and abstraction.

Poly means many and morph means form. So, polymorphism means many forms. It is the ability of different classes to implement the same methods to perform different behaviors. For example, a Bird and an Airplane class can both implement a `fly` method. They both will fly very differently (different forms) but thanks to abstraction, we can handle these types uniformly.

In general, we can achieve polymorphism through the inheritance of abstract and concrete classes (for example, we can write a function to make an animal speak that will work with both cats and dogs) and through the inheritance of interfaces (for example, we can write a function that will work with any object that has a `speak` method, regardless of type). Whenever we achieve polymorphism through some form of inheritance, it is usually called _subclass_ **polymorphism**.

Now, let's look at the word "achieving": in statically typed languages, we need to think about our types and their relationship in order to convince the compiler to let us do things polymorphically - hence 'achieve'; whether that's subclass polymorphism or the more advanced (and not covered) _parametric_ polymorphism (_generics_).

Python and other dynamically typed languages allow for more _ad-hoc_(read: "whatev's") polymorphism.

In dynamically typed languages, we don't have to explicitly define the typology: a function will handle polymorphic objects in so far as the types that are passed to it have the necessary attributes and methods. If they don't, we will get a `runtime error`.

This "I don't care who you are, I just care what you do" is often called `Duck Typing`:

> "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then chances are it is a duck!"

This is both a blessing and a curse, and you should take a moment to think about the possible advantages and disadvantages of this approach:

> Go on, write something here!

### Polymorphism through inheritance

```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Cat meows")

def talk_to_an_animal(animal):
    print("Hello, animal!")
    animal.speak()

```

Try removing the inheritance from the `Dog` and `Cat` classes and see what happens.

## Relationships between objects

In object-oriented programming, objects can have relationships with other objects. There are several types of relationships, including:

- Inheritance
- Association
- Aggregation
- Composition

Inheritance, we already discussed. Association is just another term for "some relationship" - it is the most general term for a relationship between objects.

Aggregation and composition are more specific types of relationships.

### Aggregation and composition

When discussing object-oriented programming, we often talk about relationships between objects. Two common types of relationships are aggregation and composition.

These two are often confused, but the difference is significant, if subtle.

#### Aggregation

Refers to an object having a reference to another object (or objects). The objects are independent of each other, and the child object can exist without the parent object.

Examples of aggregation include a `Garage`-type having a `Car`-type object; a `Library`-type object having a `Book`-type object; a `Classroom`-type object having a `Student`-type objects, and so forth. Cars, books, and students can all exist independently of their 'container'.

#### Composition

Also involves an object having a reference to another object (or objects). However, the objects are **dependent** on each other, and the child object cannot exist without its parent (referer) object.

Examples of composition include a `Person` object having a `Heart` object, or a `Car` object having an `Engine` object. A `Heart` cannot exist without a `Person`, and an `Engine` cannot exist without a `Car`.

## UML Class Diagrams (optional)

In the past, this was a mandatory part of the course, but it is now optional. Nevertheless, you will frequently see object-oriented design expressed in UML, so it is worth having some basic familiarity with this notation.

### Inheritance relationship

An inheritance relationship can be expressed as a solid line with a hollow arrowhead pointing to the superclass.

For example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
    class Animal{
        -name: str
        +speak() void
    }
    class Dog{
        +bark() void
    }
    class Cat{
        -color: str
        +meow() void
    }
```

### Association relationship

An association relationship can be expressed as a solid line between two classes. It is often annotated with a label to indicate the nature of the relationship.

For example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Person -- Cat: feeds
```

### Aggregation relationship

An aggregation relationship can be expressed as a solid line with a hollow diamond at the parent class.

For example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Garage o-- Car
```

### Composition relationship

A composition relationship can be expressed as a solid line with a solid diamond at the parent class.

For example:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Car *-- Engine
```

## Exercises

1. Create a class `Shape` with an abstract method `area`. Create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape`. Implement the `area` method for each subclass.

2. Create a `BankAccount` class with private attributes for `account_number` and `balance`. Implement methods to `deposit`, `withdraw`, and view the current `balance`.

3. Complete the KBA exercises.

### Advanced exercises

These exercises are not mandatory.

1. Implement a payment system where a base class `Payment` has a method `authorize_transaction()`. Create different payment method classes like `CreditCardPayment`, `DebitCardPayment`, and `PayPalPayment`, each implementing the authorization method differently (that can just be a print statement for now).
   1. Demonstrate that you can authorize transactions without any knowledge of the specific payment method.
   2. What would be the benefits of implementing `authorize_transaction` as an abstract method in the `Payment` class?
