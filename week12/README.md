# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
##### Part2
## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce you to the fundamentals of Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) using Python. 
You will learn about abstraction and polymorphism.

We will then introduce the Raspebrry PI
## Duration

2 hours

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Define abstraction, polymorphism
2. Differentiate between each of the four pillars
3. Use abstract classes and methods


## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals
- Familiarity with basic OOP

## Materials

- Python 3.x installed on students' computers
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing Python code

## Lesson Outline

1. Revision: creating objects
2. Commonality between objects
3. Inheritance facilitated polymorphism
4. Abstraction facilitated polymorphism
5. Hands-on practice
6. Recap and closing

## Lesson Details

### 1. Revision  (15 minutes)

- Create two classes: Circle and Square. Each class has the appropriate 
  attributes for that shape and a method to return the area.


### 2. Abstraction and polymorphism (30 minutes)

- See example `shapes.py`

### 3. Remote development and introduction to RaspberryPi
