# Readme, session 11

These are the code snippets written during the course of session 11.
I've cleaned them up a little bit, and added some contextualising comments,
but they're really meant to be looked at in conjunction with the recording for 
the session 11 lecture for this semester.

Start by looking at the module examples first, `animals.py` and `module_example.py`.

Then you can look at the class example, `cat.py`. 

Think: How could you use what you know about modules to compose classes nicely? 
Bear in mind that it's neater if you only define one class per python file.

# More detail!
If you want a full refresher of classes, you can read `lesson.md`.  

Additionally, `lesson.md` explains `self` a little bit more clearly -- I'll talk about it 
myself next week, but it might be nice to read ahead.

There's also some good extension exercises at the end of the lesson.md that are worth trying!
